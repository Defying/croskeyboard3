# croskeyboard3
HID Keyboard driver with function keys for Chromebooks that use the Chromium EC. Now in Poker 2 layout!

# Compatibility
Works on the Chromebook Pixel and any chromebook released after the Pixel.

# Function key mapping

Things are a bit different from CoolStar's driver, as I've tried to mimic the Poker 2 layout (what I use daily).

The top row (brightness, volume, etc) keys now work like they do in Chrome OS, requiring no modifiers to be held to use them.

Right Control is now a "Fn" key.

Fn + 1 = F1

Fn + 2 = F2

Fn + 3 = F3

Fn + 4 = F4

Fn + 5 = F5

Fn + 6 = F6

Fn + 7 = F7

Fn + 8 = F8

Fn + 9 = F9

Fn + 0 = F10

Fn + "-/_" = F11

Fn + "=/+" = F12 

Fn + i = Insert

Fn + P = Print Screen

Fn + [ = Scroll Lock

Fn + ] = Pause/Break

Fn + ' = Page Up

Fn = / = Page Down

Fn + ; = Home

Fn + . = End

Fn + Backspace = Delete

Fn + Enter = Numpad Enter
